# What are Credits? #

Credits are a type of currency that are created and stored in computers, by downloading the wallet you yourself can store and even create your own. There are many ways you can get Credits, the most common way is through a process called “mining”. Using this method, your computer solves complex mathematical equations, completion results in reward, and the economy prospers. After getting them, Credits can be spent on a wide array of items in the official Credit Marketplace, a kind of crypto-Etsy, as well as traded interpersonally and in time, used in physical stores. With the advent of Cryptocurrencies and the exponentially increasing difficulty of mining bitcoin the net has flooded with alternative solutions. Unfortunately, the crypto-world has become littered with scam coins, pump and dump schemes, and unstable financial bubbles. WIth an algorithm designed to limit both the overwhelming advantage of early adopters and the rapidly diminishing returns that characterise current Cryptos, Credits are made to serve the general public as well as enthusiasts. Using our algorithms to change block rewards cyclically, increasing and decreasing over time. This design ensures healthy market activity and prosperous mining for newcomers and veterans alike.
